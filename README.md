**1. Introduction**
Start by providing a brief introduction to the project. Describe the purpose of the application and the problem it solves. Mention the scope of the documentation covering both the frontend and backend components.

**2. Technology Choices**
Frameworks and Languages
**Node.js**: Chosen for the backend because of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture which is suitable for data-intensive applications that require real-time operation.
**Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node.
**React.js** (if used in the frontend): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you can manage state and view transitions efficiently.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database, chosen for its flexibility with schema design, scalability with high performance for large volumes of data, and its strong querying capabilities.
Libraries and Tools
**Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and their representation in MongoDB.
**CORS**: A node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) with various options.

**3. Assumptions Made**
The application assumes that all users will have a stable internet connection.
It is assumed that MongoDB Atlas service is always available for database operations.
The application does not handle user authentication as it was not part of the requirements.

**4. Test Cases**
Backend
**Unit Tests**
Vehicle Model Test: Verify that the vehicle model correctly validates data before saving to the database (e.g., unique VIN, required fields like License Plate).
API Routes Test: Test each API endpoint (like GET /vehicles) to ensure it returns the correct HTTP status and data format.
javascript
app.get('/vehicles', async (req, res) => {
  const vehicles = await Vehicle.find(); // Fetch all vehicles
  res.json(vehicles);
});
**Integration Tests**
**Database Connection Test**: Test the database connection to ensure the application can connect and disconnect without errors.
End-to-End API Functionality: Test the complete workflow from adding a new vehicle to retrieving it via the API.


**Component Tests:** Test critical components (like vehicle list and vehicle form) to ensure they render correctly.
Integration Tests: Simulate user interactions and API calls to verify that the frontend correctly interacts with the backend.
